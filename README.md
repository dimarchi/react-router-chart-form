An archived repo, no longer maintained. This would need a rewrite to work properly after four years (at the time of writing this).

Simple React basic HTML form. Temperature forecast for the desired location (the next 40 entries, from OpenWeatherMap). Using Chart.js to display the data. This differs from my previous similar exercise in using React's BrowserRouter and displaying more data in addition to drawing a canvas element utilising that data. Many parts owe a lot to the work done by other people, and their contributions are mentioned in the code comments.
